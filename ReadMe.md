# OnlineBookShopApp (Client‑only)

A single‑page Online Book Shop implemented entirely in client‑side code. All UI, state and data persistence run in the browser (localStorage or an optional mock API). This repository is a front‑end learning project and not a production backend.

## Features
- Browse and search books (title, author, category)
- Book detail pages with cover, description and price
- Shopping cart and checkout flow (mock payments; simulated in‑browser)
- Admin pages for managing books and orders (client‑side protected routes — not secure)
- REST‑style mock API support for development (optional)
- Simple authentication simulated in the client (localStorage)

## Tech stack (suggested)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind

## Prerequisites
- Git

## Quick start (client only)
1. Clone repository
    - git clone <repo-url>
2. Run index.html
